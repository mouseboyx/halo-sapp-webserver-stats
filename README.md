# halo-sapp-webserver-stats
Using the sapp extension for halo servers and the http request this aims to log information about games currently and historically.

This requres the http request for sapp found here https://opencarnage.net/index.php?/topic/5998-sapp-http-client/

This is far from being completed

These are the files, but installation currently requires setting up mysql tables by hand and putting the files in correct directories on the web and halo server
