# halo-sapp-webserver-stats
Using the sapp extension for halo servers and the http request this aims to log information about games in real time save the information.

This requres the http request for sapp found here https://opencarnage.net/index.php?/topic/5998-sapp-http-client/

This is far from being completed, a fully functional admin web console that can manage the servers is being added, along with an install script that runs in /admin on the webserver when it is first deployed.

Using /yourDocumentRootHere/halo/  for the php files, and the lua script goes in My Documents/My Games/Halo/sapp/lua/
